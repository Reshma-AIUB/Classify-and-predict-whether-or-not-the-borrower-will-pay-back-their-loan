# Classify-and-predict-whether-or-not-the-borrower-will-pay-back-their-loan
We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from here or just use the csv already provided. It's recommended you use the csv provided as it has been cleaned of NA values.
