# Classify-and-predict-whether-or-not-the-borrower-will-pay-back-their-loan
We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from here or just use the csv already provided. It's recommended you use the csv provided as it has been cleaned of NA values.


My Contribution 

1.  Import Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
2.  Create a histogram of two FICO distributions on top of each other
3.  Create a similar figure, except this time select
4.  Create a countplot using seaborn showing the counts of loans by purpose
5.  Check the documentation for lmplot
6.  Use sklearn to split your data into a training set and a testing set as we've done in the past
7.  Create predictions from the test set and create a classification report and a confusion matrix
